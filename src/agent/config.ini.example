; This is a sample configuration file for the agent.
;
; INSTRUCTIONS:
; 1. Create a copy of this file and rename it to 'config.ini'.
; 2. Fill in the values ​​below with your actual settings.
; 3. The 'config.ini' file is ignored by Git and should NEVER be pushed
; to the repository, as it contains sensitive information.
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
; In a real-world scenario, having a static, plaintext API URL in this file
; is a significant SECURITY FLAW.
;
; - The URL acts as a static "Indicator of Compromise" (IoC). If the agent
; is discovered, this URL can be used to identify and take down the entire
; C2 infrastructure.
;
; - The professional approach uses abstraction layers, such as "Redirectors"
; (disposable servers), to protect the real address of the main C2.
